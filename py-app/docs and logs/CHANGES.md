# Database Integration - Changes Summary

## Overview
Successfully connected the Shiny for Python app to the `austin_restaurants.db` SQLite database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `app.py`

#### Added Imports
```python
import sqlite3
import os
```

#### Rewrote `load_data()` Function
**Before**: Mock data with 3 sample restaurants  
**After**: Full SQLite database integration with 3,566 restaurants and 16,509 reviews

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic path resolution (works from py-app directory)
- SQL JOIN between `restaurants` and `place_details` tables
- Filters for operational businesses only
- Converts Unix timestamps to datetime for reviews
- Type conversion for boolean columns (SQLite stores as 0/1)
- Excludes reviews without text
- Includes comprehensive restaurant attributes:
  - Basic: name, address, rating, price_level, coordinates
  - Amenities: vegetarian options, dine-in, takeout, delivery
  - Services: beer, wine, meal types (breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner)
  - Contact: website, phone number

#### Updated Filters
- Changed cuisine filter to reflect actual data categories
- All existing filters work with real database data

### 2. Created `test_db_connection.py`
- Standalone test script to verify database connectivity
- Displays sample data and statistics
- Useful for debugging and validation

### 3. Created Documentation
- `README.md`: Comprehensive project documentation
- `QUICK_START.md`: Quick reference guide for running the app

## Database Statistics

```
Total Restaurants: 3,566 (operational only)
Total Reviews: 16,509 (with text)
Average Rating: 4.26
Restaurants with Price Info: 2,293
```

## SQL Queries Used

### Restaurants Query
```sql
SELECT 
    r.id, r.name, r.address, r.rating, r.price_level,
    r.user_ratings_total, r.lat, r.lng, r.place_tags as cuisine,
    COALESCE(pd.serves_vegetarian_food, 0) as serves_vegetarian,
    COALESCE(pd.dine_in, 0) as dine_in,
    COALESCE(pd.takeout, 0) as takeout,
    -- ... additional fields ...
FROM restaurants r
LEFT JOIN place_details pd ON r.id = pd.id
WHERE r.business_status = 'OPERATIONAL'
```

### Reviews Query
```sql
SELECT 
    id as restaurant_id,
    author_name as author,
    rating, text, time
FROM reviews
WHERE text IS NOT NULL AND text != ''
```

## Testing Results

✅ Database connection successful  
✅ Data loading working (3,566 restaurants, 16,509 reviews)  
✅ Shiny app starts without errors  
✅ HTTP server responding on port 8000  
✅ All columns properly mapped and typed  

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing UI components work unchanged
- Filter logic remains the same
- ML/NLP functions (TF-IDF, sentiment, topics) work with real data
- Plotly visualizations render correctly with larger dataset

## Performance Notes

- Initial data load: ~2-3 seconds
- Data cached in memory after first load
- SQL queries use indexed columns (id fields)
- LEFT JOIN ensures all restaurants included even without detailed info

## Next Development Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Add caching layer (Redis/pickle) for faster loads
2. Implement cuisine type extraction from place_tags
3. Add outdoor seating detection from reviews/photos
4. Create database update/refresh mechanism
5. Add distance filtering (requires user location or center point)
6. Implement pagination for large result sets
7. Add restaurant detail view with all photos
8. Export search results to CSV/PDF

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, revert `app.py` to use mock data:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- py-app/app.py
```

Or restore the original `load_data()` function from version control.
