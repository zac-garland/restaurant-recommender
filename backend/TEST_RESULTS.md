## ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings

### Strengths:
1. **Context Understanding**: BERT successfully interprets multi-word contextual phrases like "anniversary," "late night after concert," "Sunday morning brunch"
2. **Dietary Awareness**: Accurately distinguishes vegan, plant-based, and gluten-free requirements
3. **Atmosphere Matching**: Semantic search picks up on "romantic," "casual," "modern," "upscale" descriptors
4. **Distance Filtering**: Haversine calculation working correctly, results sorted by proximity when specified
5. **Price Filtering**: Max price level constraint properly applied
6. **Review Integration**: Top reviews successfully fetched and truncated to 150 characters
7. **Multi-constraint Handling**: Queries with 6-8 different requirements still return relevant results

### Database Schema:
- âœ… Fixed: Reviews table uses `'id'` column (not `'restaurant_id'`) for linking
- âœ… Restaurant tags: Comma-separated in `place_tags` column
- âœ… Coordinates: Using `lat`/`lng` with aliases `latitude`/`longitude` for frontend compatibility

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "id": "ChIJ...",
  "name": "Restaurant Name",
  "business_status": "OPERATIONAL",
  "price_level": 2.0,
  "rating": 4.5,
  "user_ratings_total": 500.0,
  "address": "123 Street, Austin",
  "lat": 30.2672,
  "lng": -97.7431,
  "place_tags": "restaurant,food,point_of_interest",
  "distance": 1.23,
  "similarity": 0.645,
  "top_review": "First 150 chars of review...",
  "latitude": 30.2672,
  "longitude": -97.7431
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: ~500-800ms per search (including BERT embedding generation)
- **Results Returned**: Top 10 most relevant
- **Similarity Scores**: Range from 0.25 to 0.70 depending on query specificity
- **Distance Calculation**: Accurate to 2 decimal places (miles)

---

## ðŸš€ Recommendations for Frontend
1. **Display similarity score** as "Match %" to users
2. **Highlight top review** in popups to show why restaurant matched
3. **Use distance** for sorting when multiple high-similarity results
4. **Show price level** as $ symbols (already implemented)
5. **Color-code markers** by similarity score (green=high, yellow=medium, red=low)

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps
- [ ] Consider caching BERT embeddings for common queries
- [ ] Add pagination for >10 results
- [ ] Implement fuzzy matching for misspellings
- [ ] Add cuisine type filter dropdown based on `place_tags`
- [ ] Consider adding time-based filtering (breakfast/lunch/dinner hours)
